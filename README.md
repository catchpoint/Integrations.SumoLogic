# Catchpoint - Sumo Logic Integrations

## Introduction

Sumo Logic is a cloud-based log management and analytics service that leverages machine-generated big data to deliver real-time IT insights. This document explains how to integrate Catchpoint with Sumo Logic, so that you can view Catchpoint's network telemetry data within Sumo Logic. This is accomplished by configuring Webhooks in Catchpoint and an HTTP Source in Sumo Logic. Once the integration is configured, you can visualize the data within Sumo Logic using the default dashboard or your own custom dashboards.

**Log Types**

Catchpoint pushes JSON-formatted test data to Sumo Logic using an HTTP/HTTPS Post request. The data is pushed after each test run via the protocol defined in the Sumologic endpoint URL.

## Prerequisites

1. Sumo Logic account

## Installation Configuration

**Sumo Logic Setup:**

**Set up an HTTP Source for Catchpoint.**

1. In Sumo Logic, select Manage Data > Collection > Setup Wizard, then select "Start streaming data to Sumo Logic."

1.  Select your custom app and choose "HTTPS Source."

	![Sumo Logic Setup : step 2](https://github.com/catchpoint/Integrations.SumoLogic/blob/main/Screenshots/sumo%20step2.png)

1. Enter `Catchpoint-Testdata-Webhooks` as the Source Category, then click Next.

1. Copy the HTTP Source URL that appears on the resulting page. This will be
required when configuring Catchpoint Test data webhooks. After copying the URL click Next.

**Catchpoint Setup:**

Add the copied URL to Catchpoint.

1.	In catchpoint, from `Settings` go to the [API page](https://portal.catchpoint.com/ui/Content/Administration/ApiDetail.aspx).
2.	Enable and expand Test Data Webhook, then click "Add URL"
3.	Input a friendly name for this webhook in the Name field, e.g. "Sumo Logic Endpoint"
4.	Paste the copied URL into the URL field.
5.	Select the default `JSON` as the Format, then save the changes.

_Note : Test data webhook should be enabled under the test properties page._

**Configure the Catchpoint dashboard**

The Catchpoint app for Sumo Logic includes a default dashboard, and is the central location for viewing and analyzing Catchpoint test data within your Sumo Logic account. The default dashboard enables you to quickly see your recent Errors, Events, and Alerts. The Node Map provides a geographical overview of your test runs, and the Tests Widget lets you search for and quickly access all of your synthetic test data. 

**Install the Catchpoint app for Sumo Logic**

To install the Catchpoint app: 

1.	Sign in to the `Sumo Logic` console. 
2.	Click `App Catalog`. 
3.	Search for `Catchpoint app` and select it. 
4.	Select the `version` of the service you're using.
5.	Click `Add to Library`.

**Filter the dashboard**

Click the filter icon in the top-left corner of the dashboard to display a list of filters you can apply across the entire dashboard. Use the filters to drill down and examine the data at a more granular level.

**Query samples**

You can use the following queries to create or modify your dashboard:

Visualizing DNS Time: 

    sourceCategory=Catchpoint-Testdata-Webhooks | json field=_raw "Summary.Timing.Dns","NodeName","TestId","TestDetail.Name" as Dns,Node_Name,Test_Id,Test_Name | timeslice 1m | where Test_Name matches /^TestName$/ and Node_name matches /^NodeName$/ | avg (Dns) as Dns by Node_Name,Test_Id,_timeslice | transpose row _timeslice column Node_Name,Test_Id 

Be sure to replace `TestName` and `NodeName` in the above query with valid values.

To retrieve other metrics such as Connect, Send, or Load, replace "Summary.Timing.Dns" with the desired metric, as in the following examples:

`json field=_raw "Summary.Timing.Connect" to retrive Connect`  
`json field=_raw "Summary.Timing.Send" to retrieve Send`
